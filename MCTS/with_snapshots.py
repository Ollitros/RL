        Warning! Snapshots can be arbitrary things (strings, integers, json, tuples)
        Don't count on them being pickle strings when implementing MCTS.

        Developer Note: Make sure the object you return will not be affected by
        anything that happens to the environment after it's saved.
        You shouldn't, for example, return self.env.
        In case of doubt, use pickle.dumps or deepcopy.
